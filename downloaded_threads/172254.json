        "content": "@s.anand @carlton @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj\n“Students are allowed to take help from their pets in completing assignments.”\nSo I did. \n\n Confession: My Labrador Did All My Assignments \nYes, I got great marks in Assignments, ROEs, and Project 1.\nBut let’s be real…\nIt was my Labrador who did the actual work \nWhile I was snoozing through deadlines, he was:\n\nSolving deployment issues faster than my dev server boots\nWriting function calling code like a true GPT whisperer\nFixing LLM bugs that I didn’t even understand\n\nMeanwhile, I was just vibing in my blanket.\nHe growled at broken APIs.\nI took the credit. \n\n Message from the Dog Developer:\n\n“Thank you all for an awesome semester!\nI learned more than some juniors. From containerization to prompt tuning.\nBut I am personally offended by one thing…”\n\n\n“How dare you give bonus marks on Week 7?\nI skipped it — just like many — because we were told only best 4 of 7 would count.\nI demand justice. And a belly rub.”\n– , Full-stack Labrador & Part-time Therapist\n\n\n Moral of the story:\nLet your pets help with your coursework.\nYou get the grade. They get the rage."
