The four communities are: Silver Springs Community : (42.1029,-85.665) ;Pleasant Harbor Community : (42.1238,-85.9043);Summit Shores Village : (42.0415,-85.8696);River Retreat Outpost : (42.0417,-85.6836) & Central Command Post Location: (42.0587,-85.7226) Using the Haversine package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Silver Springs Community. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance\nWhose options provided are :\n10418 meters\n12287 meters\n10965 meters\n11149 meters\nHowever, after trying all methods out there my distance comes out to be 6873 meters, I selected 10418 as the answer (closest approximation to 6873 meters)\nI assume that the question must have been central command post to summit shores village (whose answer turns out to be 12287 meters)\nKindly look into the question, and let me know about the same (the destination from central command post)"
