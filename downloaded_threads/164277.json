It WILL change.\nDon’t rely on the dataset being the same. It WILL change.\nLLMs give different results each time they are called. Make sure:\n\nYour code gives correct results reliably (i.e. try a few times)\nChange the task in the evaluation script slightly to test variations\n\n\nYour AI Proxy usage resets on 1 Feb. You have a limited budget. Utilize what you can this month.\nFor those who submit their code by Friday 31 Jan, I will run a sample evaluation and share the results.\n"

The keys to a successful Project 1 are:\nDeliverables,\nand an example of the Evaluation has been provided.\nIf your project runs in accordance with the Evaluation methodology then it is considered.\nScreenshot 2025-01-27 at 8.35.23 am1764×1764 374 KB\nPlease read the documentation carefully from top to bottom.\nSo the main question is how do you test if the script will run according to the evaluation? The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you achieve that is up to you. But if we cannot run your docker container according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this crucial test.\nKind regards"
