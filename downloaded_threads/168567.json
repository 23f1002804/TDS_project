Implicit learning. \n\nImplicit learning is “How much can they answer if woken up from sleep?”\nExplicit learning is “How much can they answer given time and Internet?”\n\nSome may know 10% implicitly. Some know 50%. They’ll answer those in a few seconds. \nSome, they can FIND out. with Google, StackOverflow, ChatGPT. That’s explicit learning. But it takes time…\n  \n\n"
